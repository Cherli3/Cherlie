    <h1></h1>
    <p class="Center"> Cherlie's First Person Controller Or CFPC for short</p>
    <p class="Center">CFPC is made for Godot 4.2x</p>
    <p class="Center">This controller is has your basic needs but along with features such as</p>
    <h1>Movement Mechanics</h1>
    <p class="Center">Movement mechanics like Crouching Sliding and fun combos like Slide hopping and Crouch hopping</p>
    <h1>True Stair collision</h1>
    <p class="Center">Tired of adding Invisible ramps to your stair collision well no need,
        this controller works with proper stair collision and max stair height is adjustable</p>
    <h1>Quick and easy adjustment</h1>
    <p class="Center">Adjust all of these settings quickly by press on the player node and adjusting values on the properties panel.

        The code is annotated so hopefully it should be easy to understand even for people just starting out</p>
    <h1></h1>
    <p class="Center">History of my movement controller. So the first tutorial i ever followed in Godot was how to make a First Person Controller.
         It was a video by a dev named LUKKY and after ages i added my own things to the controller and this template is a cleaned up version of 
         my version of lukkies controller</p>
